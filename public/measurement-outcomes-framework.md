## Overview

### Purpose of This Framework

This measurement framework helps educators and administrators:
- **Evaluate** the effectiveness of Nebula Maze in your context
- **Document** learning outcomes for stakeholders (parents, admin, funders)
- **Improve** implementation based on data
- **Demonstrate** return on investment (ROI)
- **Contribute** to broader research on game-based learning

### Measurement Philosophy

**Balanced Approach**: Combine quantitative metrics (test scores, usage data) with qualitative insights (student voice, teacher observations)

**Growth-Oriented**: Focus on improvement over time, not just absolute performance

**Context-Aware**: Recognize that effectiveness varies by student population, implementation model, and educational goals

**Actionable**: Collect data that informs decisions and improvements, not just for compliance

## Measurement Domains

### Domain 1: Academic Achievement

**What We Measure**: Mastery of content standards (math, science, social studies, ELA)

**Indicators**:
- % of standards mastered (>70% accuracy on in-game questions)
- Growth in standards mastery over time
- Alignment with external assessments (benchmark tests, state tests)
- Transfer to classroom performance (homework, quizzes, projects)

**Data Sources**:
- In-game performance data
- Pre/post assessments
- Classroom grades
- Standardized test scores

---

### Domain 2: Engagement & Motivation

**What We Measure**: Student engagement, intrinsic motivation, attitudes toward learning

**Indicators**:
- Time on task (minutes played per week)

- Persistence (continues despite difficult questions)
- Self-reported enjoyment and interest
- Attendance on game days

**Data Sources**:
- Usage analytics (automatic)
- Student surveys

**Indicators**:
- Self-awareness: Recognizing emotions, self-assessment accuracy
- Self-management: Goal-setting, perseverance, handling frustration
- Social awareness: Empathy, perspective-taking (in game scenarios)
- Relationship skills: Collaboration (if using multiplayer features)
- Responsible decision-making: Ethical reasoning in game choices

**Data Sources**:
- SEL question performance in game
- Pre/post SEL assessments (e.g., DESSA, CASEL screeners)
- Teacher observations (SEL rubrics)
- Student reflections

---

### Domain 4: Cognitive & Metacognitive Skills

**What We Measure**: Problem-solving, critical thinking, strategic thinking, self-regulation

**Indicators**:

---

### Domain 5: Equity & Inclusion

**What We Measure**: Equitable access, outcomes, and engagement across student groups

**Indicators**:
- Access: % of students with regular access to game
- Usage: Comparable engagement across subgroups (race, gender, SES, ELL, SpEd)
- Outcomes: Comparable growth across subgroups
- Perception: All students feel the game is for them

**Data Sources**:
- Usage data disaggregated by subgroup
- Achievement data disaggregated by subgroup
- Student surveys (sense of belonging)
- Focus groups with underrepresented students

---

## Data Collection Methods

### 1. In-Game Analytics (Automatic)

**Collected Automatically**:
- Questions attempted, correct/incorrect
- Time spent (per session, per question)
- Standards covered
- Difficulty levels attempted
- Progression through game (levels completed)
- Patterns (e.g., time of day, day of week)

**Advantages**: No additional work, real-time, granular, longitudinal

**Limitations**: Only measures what happens in-game, not transfer to other contexts

**Access**: Teacher dashboard (all license tiers), exportable reports (School License+)

---

### 2. Pre/Post Assessments

**Purpose**: Measure growth in content knowledge

**Recommended Schedule**:
- **Pre-Assessment**: Before starting Nebula Maze (baseline)

**Assessment Options**:

**Option A: Standards-Based Formative Assessments**
- Create or use existing assessments aligned with target standards
- 10-20 questions per assessment
- Multiple-choice or short-answer format
- Examples: District benchmark tests, MAP Growth, iReady

**Option B: Create Custom Aligned Assessments**
- Select 15-20 questions from Nebula Maze question bank
- Administer on paper or via Google Forms
- Ensures perfect alignment with game content

**Analysis**: Compare pre and post scores; calculate growth (e.g., +15% = significant growth)

**Template**: See Section 5 for Pre/Post Assessment Template

---

### 3. Student Surveys

## Data Analysis Guide

### Quantitative Analysis

#### 1. Pre/Post Assessment Growth

**Calculate Growth**:
- **Individual Growth**: Post Score % - Pre Score % = Growth %
- **Class Average Growth**: Mean(all student growth scores)
- **Effect Size** (for research): (Mean Post - Mean Pre) / SD Pre

**Interpretation**:
- **Small Growth**: 5-10% increase
- **Moderate Growth**: 10-20% increase
- **Large Growth**: >20% increase

**Disaggregation**: Analyze by subgroup (gender, race, ELL, SpEd) to assess equity

**Example**:
> Pre-assessment class average: 58%
> Post-assessment class average: 74%
> Growth: +16% (moderate growth, educationally significant)

---

#### 2. In-Game Performance Trends

**Key Metrics**:
- **Accuracy Rate**: % of questions answered correctly (target: >70%)
- **Standards Mastery**: % of standards where student achieves 70%+ accuracy
- **Engagement**: Average minutes per week (target: 60-120 minutes)
- **Growth Over Time**: Improvement in accuracy from Week 1 to Week 12

**Visualizations**:
- Line graph: Accuracy over time (weeks)
- Bar chart: Standards mastery by student or class
- Heat map: Engagement by student and week

---

#### 3. Survey Analysis

**Likert Scale Items** (1-5):
- Calculate mean scores per item and per section
- Compare across time points (baseline, mid, end)
- Look for trends: Are scores increasing, stable, or decreasing?

**Interpretation** (1-5 scale):
- 1.0-2.0 = Negative/Low
- 2.1-3.0 = Neutral/Moderate
- 3.1-4.0 = Positive
- 4.1-5.0 = Highly Positive

**Statistical Tests** (optional, for research):
- Paired t-test: Compare baseline to post scores
- Effect size (Cohen's d): Standardized measure of change

**Example**:
> Survey Item: "I enjoy playing Nebula Maze."
> Baseline: Mean = 3.8 (Positive)
> Mid: Mean = 4.2 (Highly Positive)
> End: Mean = 4.1 (Highly Positive)
> Interpretation: Sustained high enjoyment throughout

---

### Qualitative Analysis

#### Thematic Coding

**Process**:
1. **Read All Responses**: Get a sense of the whole dataset
2. **Identify Themes**: What patterns emerge? (e.g., "engagement," "difficulty," "fun")
3. **Code Responses**: Tag each response with relevant theme(s)
4. **Count Frequencies**: How often does each theme appear?
5. **Select Quotes**: Choose representative quotes for reporting

**Common Themes** (from pilot data):

**Positive**:
- Engagement/Fun ("It's fun and doesn't feel like learning")
- Helps Learning ("I understand math better now")
- Motivation ("I actually want to do homework now")

**Challenges**:
- Difficulty ("Some questions are too hard")
- Technical Issues ("Sometimes it's slow to load")
- Time ("Wish we had more time to play")

**Use Themes To**:
- Explain quantitative findings
- Identify areas for improvement
- Generate compelling narratives for stakeholders
